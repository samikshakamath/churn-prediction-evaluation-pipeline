# üß† Customer Churn Evaluation and Modeling Framework ‚Äì FoodCorp


 - **Author**: Samiksha Kamath 
- **Project Date**: 13/5/2025

This repository presents a structured, data-driven system for defining and evaluating customer churn in the context of transactional retail analytics. The approach goes beyond static churn labeling, introducing a dynamic, behaviorally derived churn framework. The project evaluates operational thresholds, models risk behavior, and simulates churn detection to support data-driven retention strategies.

## üìå Analytical Objectives

- Redefine churn using time-sensitive behavioral rules based on inter-transaction gaps.
- Identify optimal inactivity threshold (Œ≤) through statistical distribution analysis.
- Estimate churn impact using population-level Predicted Churn Class Counts (PCCC).
- Simulate real-time deployment logic using forward-facing churn flagging mechanics.
- Provide a lightweight, interpretable system for integration with CRM/marketing workflows.

## üìà Methodology Summary

### üß© Churn Definition
A customer is flagged as churned if:
- (current_date - last_transaction_date) > Œ≤
- - Œ≤ is a tunable threshold informed by inter-visit gap quantiles.
- Strict inequality ensures proper reactivation and one-time churn flagging.

### üîç Evaluation Pipeline
1. **Inter-Visit Distribution Analysis**  
   Quantifies customer frequency patterns to support evidence-based Œ≤ selection.

2. **Churn Impact Estimation (PCCC)**  
   For each Œ≤ value, calculates expected number of customers classified as churned.

3. **Rolling Labeling Simulation**  
   Forward simulation across time to verify:
   - No repeated churn flags
   - Reactivation is respected
   - Labeling is operationally viable
